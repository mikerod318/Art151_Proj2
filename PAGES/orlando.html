        Congrats! You sought asylum at Walt Disney World. Living the dream. With everyone else gone and unlimited shelter, food, and entertainment, 
        you have decided to ride out the apocalypse at the worlds greatest place. 
        No need to continue north as the Florida climate provides the greatest opportunity for survival.
