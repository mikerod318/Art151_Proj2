    <h2> OH NO!!</h2>
    <p>
        NYC is a dead end. As you approach the city, it has clearly been devasted by whatever event occurred. 
        Many buildings torn down to steel, heavy smoke reducing visibility. Rather than risking your life, 
        you decide to return back to the trail.
