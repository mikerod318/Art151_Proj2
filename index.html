    <p>
        BACKSTORY: 
        Welcome to the apocalypse! You have awoken from a long nights sleep to find that everyone from you spring break party has gone missing! You think nothing of it, they just bailed on you to get there day started. Feeling great about the trip, you head downstairs from your hotel room, only to discover how oddly quiet it is throughout the building. 
        You decide to head to the beach to get some air and hopefully find your missing party. As you continue your stroll to the beach, you have discovered that everyone is gone! No signs of life anywhere to be found. 
        Freaking out you head back to your room, only to find no cell service works. In a frantic state of mind, you decide to pop an Adderall and start moving north to New York, hopefully finding your family and some signs of life. 
        
        Utilize your decision-making skills to survive the month-long trek north! You will encounter several obstacles, several decisions that are life and death. Good luck and have fun with it!
